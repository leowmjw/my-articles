# Feedback on MMO FOIE Article, August 17 2016

With regards to teh original article (here) [ http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/freedom-of-information-penangites-not-interested-now-that-they-have-access ], Sinar Project would want to point out some contradictions and add on some more information vis-a-vis Selangor's FOIE Implementation.

> Some of the applications were rejected because forms were not filled up properly 

> or because requests were made for the meeting minutes of local councils that can’t be given as they’re confidential, Ramasamy said. 

> The state executive council’s meeting minutes are also confidential.

Firstly; it goes against the first principles of Penang's FOIE itself which :

> An Enactment to provide for disclosure of information for **public interest** and right to access to information made by **every department of the State Government** and any other matters connected therewith.

and Section 6 (2) to make sure no technicalities will prevent putting in an application for Information Request:

> .. any person who is unable .. the Information Officer who receives such an application shall reduce the said oral application into writing

**Section 6**

Again, more protection to ensure information is not denied on a technicality or from procedures (e.g signing Statutory Declarations):

	..
	where any such application does not fully adhere to the prescribed form, the application may not be refused by the Information Officer for that reason.


Here, again we can see Penang's FOIE ; see the [MBPJ OSC Minutes](http://data.sinarproject.org/dataset/mbpj-minutes-index-jawatankuasa-osc-2015)

In any case; Section 11 only covers (which already is over-broad); unlike in Selangor where EXCO Minutes are NOT in the Exception list.  No where in the list does Local Council Minutes fall into this category.


> Ramasamy said the state government is considering holding more briefings for civil servants to train them on the importance of FOI, as the last one was held before the Enactment was enforced in January last year. 

.  Proper training to recognize personal information and judiciously remove/redact them.  

As found out during Selangor's public SELCAT hearing on the FOIE Implementation; , as there are many grey area situations that will only be encountered in real life production running of the process.

Ramasamy is incorrect in the below; only internal deliberation but decisions should be justified.

How can citizens participate if minutes of deliberation are not accessible for public to hold the elected representatives accountable.  In the case of Local Councillors; this is even more imprtant as the positions are not up for election.  Really sensitive information (which should be very narrow and well-defined) should be redacted but the whole document shold be released.

For more details on the Sinar Project's proposal, readers are encouraged to read up the : [Recommendations to Improve Penang FOIE](https://right2know.my/2016/08/12/recommendations-to-improve-penang-freedom-of-information-enactment-foie/)
