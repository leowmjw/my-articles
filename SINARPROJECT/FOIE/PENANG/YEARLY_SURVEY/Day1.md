# Day 1

- Looked up the MBPP Information Officer; En. Ramjan, friendly, will get back data on Wednesday
- Looked up SUK Information Officer; Puan Subamalar; transferred to UPEN.  Did not get to speak to En. Baharom who was so helpful last year.
- Replacement SUK IO was not helpful; very hostile and was unwilling to share latest Information Officer lists; due to it not being in the Warta, unlike in Selangor.
- Will have to an on-the-ground survey to see what has changed.
- Will also attempt to check with the HR department for the updated list like what is available in Selangor (Floor 45, PSUKPP)
