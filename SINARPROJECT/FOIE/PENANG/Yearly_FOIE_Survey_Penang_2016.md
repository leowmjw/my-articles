Notes:

Ramasamy is incorrect in the below; only internal deliberation but decisions should be justified.

How can citizens participate if minutes of deliberation are not accessible for public to hold the elected representatives accountable.  In the case of Local Councillors; this is even more imprtant as the positions are not up for election.  Really sensitive information (which should be very narrow and well-defined) should be redacted but the whole document shold be released.

```
Some of the applications were rejected because forms were not filled up properly or because requests were made for the meeting minutes of local councils that can’t be given as they’re confidential, Ramasamy said. The state executive council’s meeting minutes are also confidential.
