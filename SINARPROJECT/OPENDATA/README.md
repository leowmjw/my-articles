### My message to the delegates:
- Open Standards (Popolo) + format for reuse
- Capacity building 
- Regional collaboration (ASEAN + beyond)
-

Data needs to represent underserved; as per our Public Housing case by colleagues (PPR Kota Damansara)

Great cas eis Myanmar + Open Hluttaw

### Needed Pre-reqs:
	- Right To Know Law is a needed unless gov is really pragmatic like SG
        - Ombudsman/independent official
	- Executive sponsorship; political considerations 
	- Only SIngaopre does not have; but it is a more pragmatic move

### Regional Experiences:
	- Korean's model was to throw it out there, guidance by COuncil but let private/public
	- Singapore ; a better sell would be for Gov2Gov improvements, no clear picture on economic benefits yet
	- Phillipines (Singapore too) suggests to get started; go for low hanging furits, small wins to be built on 
	- Indonesia, Philippines and Singapore suggest to go beyond Hackathons, to have Business Incbators

### Best Practices:
- Inclusive Working Group (see the Koreans)
- Implement via Information Commissioner-like Office; good choice as secretariat/officers as they are trained in data / evaluation
- Final responsibility must be from the Executive with enough power + budget (office of Preseident, Internal Ministry, Prime Minister Office but baked in Institutionally (so can be executaed by the civil servants even without political considerations) to be continued 
- Monitoring like in Korea (Chief Open Data Officer) and have dispute resolution baked into law (Ombudsman)
