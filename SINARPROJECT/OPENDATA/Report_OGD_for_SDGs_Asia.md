## Objective

## Important Learnings

 1. Nepal
 2. Bangladesh

While Malaysia does not (#openwashing); I was grateful the CSO prespective of Open Government Data within a Constrained Environemnt: 

### My message to the delegates:
- Open Standards (Popolo)
- Capacity building 
- Regional collaboration (ASEAN + beyond)
-

### Needed Pre-reqs:
	- Right To Know Law is a needed unless gov is really pragmatic like SG
	- Executive sponsorship; political considerations 
	- Only SIngaopre does not have; but it is a more pragmatic move

### Regional Experiences:
	- Korean's model was to throw it out there
	- Singapore ; a better sell would be for Gov2Gov improvements, no clear picture on economic benefits yet
	- Phillipines (Singapore too) suggests to get started; go for low hanging furits, small wins to be built on 
	- Indonesia, Philippines and Singapore suggest to go beyond Hackathons, to have Business Incbators

### Best Practices:
- Inclusive Working Group (see the Koreans)
- ; good choice as secretariat/officers as they are trained in data / evaluation
- Final responsibility must be from the Executive with enough power + budget (office of Preseident, Internal Ministry, Prime Minister Office but baked in Institutionally (so can be executaed by the civil servants even without political considerations) to be continued
