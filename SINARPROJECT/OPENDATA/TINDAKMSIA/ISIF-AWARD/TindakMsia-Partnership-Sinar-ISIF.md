##Open Geospatial Data for Basis of Governance


###Introduction

Open geospatial data is something in the Western World and some developing countries takes for granted. However, much spatial data in the developing world has been locked up under the veneer of secrecy and national security policies. 

Such policies not only hinder the full realization of potential of geospatial data but creates opacity and suspicions on government policy. Moreover, copyright policies restrict the dissemination of the information in freely and useable format.

In Malaysia, due to lack of local council elections, citizens air their discontent of failure of public service to their elected State or Federal Representatives. However, citizens may not necessarily know the geographic coverage of their constituencies.

Tindak Malaysia is a dedicated NGO for electoral reform and voter empowerment. One of our significant works was to digitize all the electoral boundaries of Malaysia and present it on what could be Malaysia’s first ever Online Electoral Map Platform. However, the datasets were kept within the confines of the organization.

Sinar Project, a dedicated Malaysian group on open data and leveraging technologies for transparency, approached Tindak Malaysia to disclose the GIS data (electoral boundaries) through their Civil Society Open Data Portal.

###Challenges and Process

Tindak Malaysia conducted significant discussions on disclosure policy of the datasets (assessing the risks). After getting internal approval from the leadership, Tindak Malaysia and Sinar Project agreed on the ownership and licensing terms of the datasets.

Secondly, the initial digitization of electoral boundaries wasn’t audited for long time and its attribute data wasn’t updated. Since the data will be disclosed for public consumption, it is imperative the datasets are accurate both in spatial and attribute terms. 

Tindak Malaysia GIS Team is currently doing a rigorous dataset audit (conform to the GIS data standards) prior to release of the datasets in the Portal. 

All the datasets disclosed by Tindak Malaysia has metadata which explicitly states the origin, disclaimers and appropriate scale to be used.

As Malaysia has 13 states and 3 territories, Tindak Malaysia electoral GIS Data is structured along 16 regions. The datasets are being released state by state and have been verified prior to release. As the moment of writing, 4 statewide datasets have been released.

In line of Open Data and GIS format standards, all the spatial datasets are released in GeoJSON format; [an example GeoJSON](https://github.com/TindakMalaysia/Selangor-Maps/blob/master/Selangor_DM_2015/Selangor_DM_2015.geojson); and metadata are released in .csv format. 

Tindak Malaysia GIS Team has ensured the uniformity of all the datasets (all the datasets would have the same set of fields and field types).

Hopefully, a single nationwide datasets will be made which unites all the 16 regions. This will feed into a different need for the audience who wants to see issue at national level, as opposed to state level.

####Moving Forward

The datasets on administrative and electoral boundaries will assist Sinar and other groups to assess on government performance. 

A good example was Open Day Hackathon organized by Sinar in [March](http://sinarproject.org/en/updates/open-data-day-2016-data-expedition) which leveraged on Tindak GIS boundary data. The boundary data was utilized to assess the teacher to student ratios in Selangor.

In longer term, the disclosure of open spatial data in this portal will allow more collaborative sharing and push the Malaysian government to do likewise.
