<h1 id="aduanku.my-reporting-issue-and-handling-issue-via-dashboard">Aduanku.my Reporting Issue and Handling Issue via Dashboard</h1>
<p>The Aduanku.my Platform is a powerful solution available to report local issues affecting the residents of PPR Kota Damansara; whether at the local Joint Management Body (JMB) level run by PHSSB or in the surrounding area under the Petaling Jaya City Council (MBPJ).</p>
<p>This short write up will present two scenarios involving the stakeholders:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>How a resident of PPR Kota Damansara can easily and safely make a report of an issue to be brought up to attention to PHSSB</p></li>
<li><p>How the staff of PHSSB can monitor issues coming in and easily track, communicate and update the handling status of any issues being brought up by the residents.</p></li>
</ol>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As a resident of PHSSB, a report can be made following the steps below:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Go to https://aduanku.my</p></li>
<li>Click on the “Report a problem” link and enter the nearest street to PPR Kota Damansara; which is “Jalan Pekaka 8/1”:

</p>
</li>
<li>Fill in all the necessary information as show below:

</p>
</li>
<li><p>As a resident, if it is a sensitive matter; contact your resource person <strong>Peng Lim</strong> via alternative channel (on Whatsapp). There should be a shared email account that can be used in this case.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As we can see in the example below; this is what PHSSB will see when a report is made:</p>
<pre><code>----------

Tracking Id: 857

Name: Sinar Project

Email: leow+aduanku@sinarproject.org

Phone: 0162332450

Category: Lampu Jalan

Subject: Test PPR Report Visibility in Dashboard

Details: Test;ignore

Latitude: 3.176146

Longitude: 101.577803</code></pre>
<p>So as long as the reporter either gets the resource person (e.g Peng Lim) to report on their behalf; or use a throw away email; PHSSB will not be able to identify the reporter.</p>
<p><strong>REMEMBER:</strong> The <strong>phone number</strong> and <strong>name</strong> field is <strong>OPTIONAL</strong> In order to obfuscate the report; use a shared email, the JMB should make contact only via email</p>

<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">## Scenario #2: PHSSB Monitoring + Updating Issues</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As the Joint Management Body (JMB) tasked with maintaining the PPR Kota Damansara blocks; PHSSB can leverage on the Aduanku platform for monitoring and keeping the residents updated about the issues reported by them.<br />All we need is the email of the PHSSB staff assigned to monitor Aduanku and they can be added in by Sinar Project.</p>
The Dashboard is available to the Public Body to have an overview of the issues and what needs to be given priority to be addressed.

</p>

They can easily update the status as work goes in progress and actions are taken. In the screeshots below, the PHSSB staff assigned just updates the state of each issue:

</p>

<p>To highlight some of the status and how it is best used:</p>
<pre><code>- Investigating: Do add any other pertinent findings in the update
- Action Scheduled: Do update when a fix is scheduled so the resident knows 
- In Progress: Inform the resident that a fix is ongoing so thy are aware
- Unable to fix: Please detail why this cannot be done
- Not Responsible: If falls under MBPJ; please help file on behalf of the 
resident
- Fixed: Attach picture to show the problem has been fixed  </code></pre>
<p>This ends the quick review over the possible scenarios; if there are anything not covered, contact us at Sinar Project for assistant to get it resolved.</p>
<p>Finally:</p>
Sinar Project, as an Admin of the Aduanku Platform; we have an overall view of all issues reported in the system. So, for example if there was a issue posted which should have been Anonymous, let us know. When facing any other situation with the Aduanku platform that you cannot resolve, get in touch immediately!:
