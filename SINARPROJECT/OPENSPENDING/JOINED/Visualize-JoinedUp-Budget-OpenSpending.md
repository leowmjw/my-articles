# Visualizing Joined UP Budget Data using OpenSpending Components

## Objective

In a constrained environment like in Malaysia as per my recent presentation:
- dd
- dd

A system as a standalone silo is not effective

## Audience

- Program Officers looking to maximize budget implementing an Application
; while maintaining the high quality
- Application Developers looking for examples of how to reuse and leverage
 high quality
- For technical description of how components were orted; cehck the companion
article

## Scenario

Every October, the Malaysian Government presents its Budget for the upcoming
year.

In order to will present the budget; how can we make it 
accessible to the general public; and who to hold accountable?

We want to be able to work with Popolo data; another project Sniar Project
has been working on  

A simple scenario demonstrating the use of thee two data sources would be
to allow the user to choose the Ministry under the Fifth Cabinet of Najib Razak
to be scrutinized

## Method

Get the components ,...]: 

It is very readable etc.

The application can be broken down simply to 3 parts:

a) Overall Application

    ![abc](./IMAGES/Demo-Minister-Chosen-Ministry.png)

    c2) Budget Details <babbage_package> component

    abc
    
### Data Sources

- OpenSpending
- PopIt for Fifth Cabinet of Najib Razak

### Further Ideas

might be to link FixMyStreet component for any complaints made
to that particular Ministry

Other ideas might be to link any issue/questions brought up in the
media for the Ministry so navigate the ownership of the problem solving


## Conclusion

In conclusion; you can see how it is possible
Do not try to solve everything with your App; reuse high quality
